## 💡 About Me

I'm a data-driven problem solver with a background in Informatics and real-world experience in enterprise performance management (EPM) consulting. Currently pursuing my Master of Science in Business Analytics, I'm passionate about turning raw data into actionable insights — whether through dashboards, statistical modeling, or scalable pipelines.

I’ve helped organizations improve financial planning, uncover inefficiencies, and align stakeholders on data-backed decisions. Now, I’m expanding my skill set to include machine learning, cloud-based data engineering, and program management.
